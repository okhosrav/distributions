# distributions
A description of negative binomial, binomial and poisson distributions

This project was inspired by the graduate bioinformatics courses I took in 2020/2021 at Western: Biochemistry 9545Q and 9546R taught by Dr. Gregory Gloor. The courses were a great learning experience, but nonetheless very challenging. This was not helped by my severe lack of understanding of what these three distributions were, how they worked and what their significances were in the contect of 'omics.

I decided to make this description partly for myself and partly for whomever else may find that it is helpful.
